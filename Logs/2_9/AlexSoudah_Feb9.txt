Update 2/9 - Alex Soudah (Power Electronics Subsystem):
- sent in order for PCB and components two days ago
- Grant helped with diagnosis of old board to see what was wrong with it
- Looking into solar panel and battery charger that was purchased to plan out how to make all of those connections in case anything is needed
