week of 2/9/2022

The concept of operation for the communication link is more or less done.
I need to search for the correct python classes to import.
By next week, my goal is to start coding with either the transmitter or the receiver.
I won't be done with it but I'll be satisfied to know how to code with the transmitter and receiver.
