Alex Soudah - Power Module - 3/2 Update:

- Boost Converter:
	- Working exactly as expected, have tested it with Grant's RF module and it successfully provides the 28V as needed/expected. 
	- Working on soldering on more permanent connectors to the board as the ones that were purchased do not fit the footprint on the board. However, will cut the connectors that were purchased and solder them on to the board to use as permanent connections. 
	- Overall, boost converter is complete and ready for integration.

- P5V and P3.3V Buck Converter:
	- Looked at absolute maximum ratings on data sheet for LTC3641 chip and found that Vin2 pin can only handle a maximum of 6V and we're feeding it 12V. The solution was to bend the pin up off of the board and instead use the output from the P5V to power the Vin2 pad which would then power the P3.3V.
	- Soldered on new chip and began testing yesterday (3/1). P3.3V output output 5V but the issue was found (resistor on the board was shifted when using the heat gun a bit before - resistor was fixed back into its intended position).

-P5V Buck Converter:
	- Soldering on new chip today and will begin testing on board today. Very similar lay out to the P3.3V board.
	- Will do same thing with the new LTC3641 chip (bending Vin2 pin).
