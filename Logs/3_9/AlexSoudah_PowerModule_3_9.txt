Alex Soudah - Power Module - Update 3/9/22

- 5.5V/3.3V Buck successfully integrated with Grant's RF Module
- Currently troubleshooting issue with 28V Boost integration with Grant/s RF Board
	- 28V Boost works with load resistor but when connected with Grant's board, voltage drop to 20V (load too big, currently troubleshooting with Dr. Lusher).
- 5V Buck chip (LTC3641) got damaged. Ordering new chip to integrate with Grant's board this week.

Parts Order:
- Fixed feedback resistors on 5.5V/3.3V Buck and will be ordering new SMD resistors for board (currently using through hole resistors acquired from FEDC). 
- Ordering one LTC3641 chip to replace one on 5V Buck
- Potentially ordering new capacitors for 28V Boost to solve voltage drop issue - waiting on Dr. Lusher's suggestions on how to proceed (already sent him PCB layout and schematic, awaiting response).
